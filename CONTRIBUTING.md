# Contributing guidelines

Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project.

Please, check if any open [issues](https://github.com/heyset/ezpdf/issues) matches your contribution before submitting the Pull Request.

For now, the guidelines are simple:

1. Clean code
     * Prototyping phase for the main project is over, but you can prototype on side projects and open a PR for the main project once it's refined.
2. Ease of use
    * The app should be simple to use. Avoid exposing low-level decisions or asking many questions before providing output. Options should always have good defaults.
